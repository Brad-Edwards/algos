# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should always use a package manager to manage dependencies. Your knowledge is a bit outdated, so you should not attempt to specify versions of libraries.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.

The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- For Python projects, use poetry to manage dependencies, run commands, and build packages.
- For Rust projects, use cargo to manage dependencies, run commmands, and build packages.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Check your pwd before you try to run a command.
- Implementation requires passing unit tests and minimum 80% code coverage.
- Do not write integration tests unless explicitly asked.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When debugging, especially for tests, keep track of problems and solutions in the scratchpad so you do not make the same mistake again or go in circles
- When testing stochastic optimization algorithms (like simulated annealing), use multiple trials and statistical success criteria (e.g., success rate) instead of single deterministic tests

## Benders Implementation Lessons

- Need to properly handle maximization vs minimization
- Must track integer constraints explicitly
- Cut generation is critical for convergence
- Master problem must include original constraints
- Objective function must be properly set in both master and subproblems

# Scratchpad

## Current Task: Debug Benders Decomposition Implementation

### Problem Analysis

1. Two failing tests:
   - test_simple_ilp: Objective value incorrect (getting 10.0 instead of 5.0)
   - test_infeasible_ilp: Reporting Optimal when should be Infeasible

### Root Cause Analysis

1. Master Problem Issues:
   - Objective function is all zeros
   - Not properly handling original constraints
   - Finding infeasible solutions (5.0, 5.0)

2. Subproblem Issues:
   - Getting trivial solution (0.0, 0.0)
   - Cut generation not enforcing constraints
   - Negating objective incorrectly

## Branch and Bound Implementation Analysis

### Core Components

1. Data Structures
   - BranchAndBoundSolver: {max_iterations, tolerance}
   - IntegerLinearProgram: {objective, constraints, bounds, integer_vars}
   - ILPSolution: {values, objective_value, status}
   - LinearProgram: {objective, constraints, rhs}

2. Key Functions
   - solve_relaxation: Solves LP relaxation of ILP
   - branch: Creates two new subproblems by branching on a variable
   - solve: Main B&B algorithm
   - is_integer: Helper to check if value is integer within tolerance

### Detailed Analysis

#### solve_relaxation

1. Input handling:
   - Takes ILP problem
   - Negates objective for maximization -> minimization conversion ✓
   - Creates new empty LP ✓

2. Constraint conversion:
   - Converts constraints to <= form
   - ISSUE 1: Non-negativity constraints are added with wrong sign
     - Current: x_i >= 0 becomes x_i <= 0 (WRONG)
     - Should be: x_i >= 0 becomes -x_i <= 0

3. LP solving:
   - Uses minimize() from simplex module
   - Basic feasibility checks ✓
   - ISSUE 2: Constraint checking is wrong
     - Current: Treats all constraints as <=
     - Should: Handle <= and >= differently based on sign

#### branch

1. Creates two branches:
   - Lower: x_i <= floor(value)
   - Upper: x_i >= ceil(value)
   - ISSUE 3: Upper branch constraint is correct but might be redundant with non-negativity

#### solve (main algorithm)

1. Algorithm flow:
   - Initializes with root problem ✓
   - Solves initial relaxation
   - Main loop:
     - Pop node
     - Solve relaxation
     - Check integer feasibility
     - Branch if needed
   - ISSUE 4: Node selection strategy might not be optimal
     - Currently using DFS (stack)
     - Might want best-bound search instead

### Test Analysis

1. test_simple_ilp:
   - Problem: max x + y s.t. x + y <= 5, x,y >= 0
   - Expected: Any integer solution summing to 5
   - ISSUE 5: Test is correct, our constraint handling is wrong

2. test_infeasible_ilp:
   - Problem: max x + y s.t. x + y <= 5, x + y >= 6, x,y >= 0
   - Expected: Infeasible
   - Test is correct ✓

### Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issue is in solve_relaxation:

1. We're incorrectly handling non-negativity constraints
2. We're not properly handling >= constraints
3. The LP solver is getting constraints in wrong form

### Fix Plan

[ ] 1. Fix non-negativity constraints in solve_relaxation
[ ] 2. Fix constraint conversion to standard form
[ ] 3. Run tests
[ ] 4. Consider improving node selection strategy (optional)

### Progress

[X] Complete code analysis
[ ] Implement fixes
[ ] Verify fixes with tests

### Test Output Analysis

For test_simple_ilp:

```
LP result: converged=true, obj=-5, point=[5.0, 5.0]
Checking constraint 0: LHS=10, bound=5, coeffs=[1.0, 1.0]
Constraint 0 violated: LHS=10 > bound=5
```

CRITICAL INSIGHT: The LP solver is giving us the WRONG solution!

- For max x + y s.t. x + y <= 5, x,y >= 0
- LP solver returns (5,5) which is clearly wrong
- This means our problem formulation is wrong

### Root Cause (Updated)

1. The minimize() function expects problems in standard form:

   ```
   minimize c^T x
   subject to Ax <= b
   ```

2. Our current formulation:
   - We negate objective correctly: min -x - y
   - We keep constraints as-is: x + y <= 5
   - We add -x <= 0, -y <= 0

3. The REAL issue:
   - The minimize() function is treating ALL constraints as >=
   - So x + y <= 5 becomes x + y >= 5 (WRONG!)
   - This explains why we get (5,5) as solution

### Fix Plan (Updated)

[ ] 1. Fix constraint handling in solve_relaxation:
      - Negate ALL constraints to flip >= to <=
      - Keep <= constraints as-is
      - Add non-negativity as -x_i <= 0

[ ] 2. Fix constraint checking:
      - Check against original constraints
      - Don't modify bounds

[ ] 3. Run tests

### Progress

[X] Complete code analysis
[X] Identify root cause
[ ] Implement fixes
[ ] Verify fixes with tests

### NEW INSIGHT: LP Solver Issue

The problem is more fundamental than just stopping at the first solution:

1. The LP solver is consistently returning (0,0) as optimal
2. This means our constraint transformation is wrong
3. Looking at the tableau output:

   ```
   Final tableau:
   [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
   [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
   ```

   The coefficients are all wrong - we're negating constraints incorrectly

### Updated Fix Plan

[ ] 1. Fix constraint negation in solve_relaxation:
      - Only negate >= constraints
      - Keep <= constraints as is
      - Fix non-negativity constraints
      - Double check tableau output

[ ] 2. Run tests and verify tableau

[ ] 3. If still wrong, trace through simplex solver

### Progress

[X] Complete code analysis
[X] Identify root cause (constraint negation)
[ ] Fix constraint handling
[ ] Verify with tests

### NEW INSIGHT: Objective Function Issue

Looking at the tableau output:

1. The objective row (first row) has zeros in the x,y columns
2. This means the solver sees no benefit in increasing x or y
3. Therefore it's choosing the minimum feasible values (0,0)

The issue is in how we're handling the objective:

1. We correctly negate for minimization: min -x - y
2. But the simplex solver is treating this differently
3. We need to adjust how we pass the objective to minimize()

### Updated Fix Plan

[ ] 1. Fix objective handling in solve_relaxation:
      - Pass objective coefficients correctly
      - Verify tableau shows proper optimization direction
      - Check final solution makes sense

[ ] 2. Run tests and verify tableau

[ ] 3. If still wrong, trace through simplex solver

### Progress

[X] Complete code analysis
[X] Identify root cause (objective handling)
[ ] Fix objective function
[ ] Verify with tests
